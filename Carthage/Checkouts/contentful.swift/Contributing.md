## Development and versioning
Development should be done with Xcode as a strict requirement of the project is that iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS stay supported. This, in turn, means that development will be done on a Mac, and it is therefore required that [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed. The `make setup_env` command will install or update the necessary brew packages required to work on the contentful.swift project (note that it will not install homebrew for you).
